    - **Volunteer:** Can sign up for delivery tasks, manage their schedule, and report on completed tasks.
    - **Recipient:** Can request assistance, receive donations, and provide feedback.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Each user role has a dedicated dashboard with relevant data visualizations and management tools.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The platform provides real-time updates on donation statuses, volunteer availability, and recipient needs.

## Running the Application Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js and npm:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3.8+ and pip:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
- **MongoDB:** [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (ensure the server is running)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kyalo3/429.git
    cd 429
    ```

2.  **Set Up and Run the Backend:**
    - Open a new terminal window.
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```sh
      cd sustainashare_backend
      ```
    - Install the required Python packages:
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Start the backend server:
      ```sh
      uvicorn app.main:app --reload
      ```
    - The backend API will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Keep this terminal open.

3.  **Set Up and Run the Frontend:**
    - Open a second terminal window.
    - Navigate to the project's root directory (`/429`).
    - Install the required npm packages:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the frontend development server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The frontend will now be running. You can access it in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, you can open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (`http://localhost:5173`) to use the application.

- **Register:** Create a new account by selecting a user role (Donor, Volunteer, or Recipient).
- **Login:** Log in with your credentials to access your dashboard and role-specific features.
